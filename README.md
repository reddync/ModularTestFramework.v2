# ModularTestFramework
 Put togther from various sources using the existing frameworks as a boiler plate. 
 
 Modular, pageobject, pagefactory,crossbrowser,TestNG,RestASssured extent report v2 with screen shot on fail, dynamic web table. 
 
 
 Still a work in progess , but allows me to write quick and easily maintainable tests.

 Oter dynamic table and attributes tests for the "Challenging DOM" assignment.
